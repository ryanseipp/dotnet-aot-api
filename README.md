# Dotnet AOT API Template

A starting point for building ASP.NET Core Web APIs with minimal APIs and Native AOT compilation.

### Features

- [x] Minimal APIs
- [x] DB access via Npgsql
- [x] Observability via OpenTelemetry
- [x] Simple Todo domain as example
- [x] Source Generator for wiring up endpoint classes
- [ ] Full-fledged authentication and user management
- [ ] Useful Grafana dashboards

### TODO

- User authentication and management is still WIP. Ideally support for email confirmation and 2FA will be added.
- Complete Todo domain and request handlers.
- Build useful Grafana dashboards for determining key performance metrics of the API.
